# WolfFang Extras+

## What is this?

WolfFang Extras+ is made as an external addon and an attempt for everyone who wants to collaborate on making extra features for Nick, and maybe some of those features might end merged into Nick WolfFang and get credited for it.

Nick code wise has a lot of stuff that can be external patched, so that might not be a problem for WolfFang Extras+ being an external addon for Nick.

## What I can collaborate or make?

- Extra taunts
- Sprites
- Gamemode or other features support
- Any extra features you wish to do

Note: Nick is not open assets, but I allow anyone to edit or make sprites in base of Nick's sprites with the only purpose to collaborate on WolfFang Extras+

All of these through pull requests and will depend to be approved/merged by me.

## What if I want to make code QoL Changes?

- You can contact me through Discord or SRB2 Message Board and send me your QoL Changes. I'll take a look if it's appropiate enough and notify you if it got approved or not. Or maybe give you feedback about it.

## Where can I send my changes?

Make a pull request on this github repo to send your changes

## Is this going to be released to the Message Board?

No, as said before, WolfFang Extras+ features might end to be merged into Nick WolfFang. but will be available on GitHub, free to host.
